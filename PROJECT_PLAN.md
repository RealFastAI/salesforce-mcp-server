# Salesforce MCP Server - Project Plan

## 📊 Current Status

## 🎉 **MILESTONES 1-2 COMPLETE** 🎉

**Phases 1-5: Foundation Through Core Tools** - ✅ **100% Complete**

### **Completed Phases Summary:**
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (MCP server, config, error handling, logging)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Salesforce Integration (OAuth2 PKCE authentication, Claude Desktop integration)
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Core MCP Tools (describe_object, list_objects, soql_query, get_record)
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Advanced Search & Discovery (SOSL search, picklist values, SOQL validation)
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Organization & User Context (user info, org limits, recent items, layout description)

### **Major Achievements:**
- **12 Tools Implemented**: Full MCP tool suite with comprehensive functionality
- **333 Tests Passing**: Complete test coverage across all modules with TDD approach
- **Production Validated**: All tools confirmed working in Claude Desktop with real Salesforce environments
- **Quality Foundation**: Modular architecture (tools.ts: 2,907→5 lines), standardized error handling, type safety
- **Security**: OAuth2 PKCE authentication, input validation, injection prevention, PII sanitization
- **Integration**: stdio transport, encrypted token storage, comprehensive error handling

## 🧹 **PHASE 6: TECHNICAL DEBT & QUALITY IMPROVEMENT** ⬅️ **CURRENT PHASE**

**Objective**: Systematic code quality review and technical debt reduction to maintain high standards as codebase matures.

### 6.1 Code Quality Assessment
- [x] **6.1.1** Create comprehensive HOUSEKEEPING.md review plan ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **6.1.2** Execute Phase 1: Architecture & Structure Review
- [x] **6.1.3** Execute Phase 2: Code Quality Deep Dive
- [ ] **6.1.4** Execute Phase 3: Testing Quality Assessment
- [ ] **6.1.5** Execute Phase 4: Performance & Maintainability Review

**Quality Target**: 9/10 code quality score across all dimensions  
**Focus**: Clean code principles, maintainability, performance optimization

## Quality Gates (Applied Throughout)

### Every Task Must Include:
- ✅ **Red**: Failing test written first
- ✅ **Green**: Minimal implementation to pass test
- ✅ **Refactor**: Code cleanup while maintaining green tests
- ✅ **Type Check**: `npm run type-check` passes
- ✅ **Lint**: `npm run lint` passes
- ✅ **Tests**: `npm run test` passes with >80% coverage
- ✅ **Build**: `npm run build` succeeds
- ✅ **Commit**: Meaningful commit message (no attribution per guidelines)

### Major Milestone Criteria:
- ✅ All tests passing (333 tests across 7 test suites)
- ✅ Type safety maintained (strict TypeScript with comprehensive validation)
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive (typed error system with MCP protocol support)
- ✅ Logging structured with correlation IDs (Pino-based system implemented)
- ✅ Performance within specifications (production-ready)
- ✅ Security best practices followed (OAuth2 PKCE, input validation, no credential exposure)
- ✅ Documentation updated (README.md, agent best practices, Neo4j backup)

### Milestone 2 Security Requirements:
- [x] **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized ✅
- [x] **Permission Filtering**: Results filtered by user permissions ✅
- [x] **PII Protection**: Sensitive data redacted from responses ✅
- [x] **Query Complexity**: SOQL/SOSL complexity limits enforced ✅
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: API call frequency controls implemented
- [ ] **Cache Security**: Prevention of cache poisoning attacks
